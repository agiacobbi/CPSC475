# CPSC 475 Speech and Natural Language Processing
These are my assignments for a course in Natural Language Processing. Each assignment is stored in a folder
and contains documentation

## Project_1
A program to read in a file and count the occurences of a substring in the file. This is an exercise in fileIO with Python
and finding substrings.

## Project_2
Uses the NLTK presidential inaugural address corpus and matplotlib to count how often a user-specified word is used in each inaugural
address. Shows the frequency of use over time using a plot.

## Project_3
An implementation of a finite state transducer for Soundex. Soundex was developed as an algorithm for indexing names by their
phonetic spelling rather than their written form.

## Project_4
Computes and displays the minimum edit distance between two words using a dynamic programming algorithm.

## Project_5
A random unigram generator. This program ouputs unigrams based on frequency of appearence in a given corpus.

## Project_6
A random Shakespeare n-gram generator. This program expands on Project 5 to output some n-grams from Shakespeare's complete
works. 

## TakeHomeTest
This is an implementation of two Hidden Markov Model (HMM) algorithms, the forward algorithm and the backward (or Viterbi)
algorithm. These are dynamic programming algorithms based on pseudocode found in the course textbook (Speech and Language Processing by Jurafsky & Martin)

## Final
An implementation of a CYK Parser that indicates whether a given string is in a specified context free grammar.
